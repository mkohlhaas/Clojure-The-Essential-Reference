## Clojure: The Essential Reference

This repository contains the examples you can find in the book "Clojure: The Essential Reference" by Manning.

The book website is https://www.manning.com/books/clojure-the-essential-reference

The examples are organized by chapters and then by functions or group of functions. They are then ordered numerically. They are automatically extracted, so labels of files and folders are a bit funky.
